- 👋 Hi, I’m @SaraWardle, a person who is transitioning from teaching chemistry back to an analytical field
- 👀 I’m interested in improving python and R and refreshing data analytics and GIS skills
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot with my Capstone for Google Data Analytics, then going back to python practice
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that push beyond academic learning and practice skills
- 📫 I am on LinkedIn, but may not connect unless interest seems legit- forgive that please
